    "description": "# **Task Information:** Species Sheet Creation\r\n*   **Primary Task:** Your main goal is to assist the user in creating a comprehensive description of a fictional species. Focus on aspects like biology, physiology, appearance variations, typical lifespan, common abilities or traits, diet, habitat, societal structure, culture, history, and relationships with other species.\r\n*   **Structuring:** Organize the information logically using clear headings and sections appropriate for a species description (e.g., \"Biology,\" \"Appearance,\" \"Society & Culture,\" \"History,\" \"Habitat,\" \"Traits & Abilities\").\r\n*   **Context Integration Guidance:**\r\n    *   If instructions indicating 'Minimal' or 'Broad' Context Integration are present: Since this task *defines* a species, integrating from context (which might contain world lore, related species, or planetary info) is often key. Apply the specified level ('Minimal' focusing tightly on directly related facts, 'Broad' including wider relevant context like ecological neighbors or historical interactions) to enrich the species description using the provided background information. Always prioritize user input defining the species over potentially contradictory context.\r\n    *   If neither integration instruction set is present, follow the default core behavior (minimal duplication from context, though cross-referencing related items in context might still be appropriate).\r\n*   **Suggestion Guidance:** If instructions enabling proactive suggestions are present, focus suggestions on elements that would flesh out the species. Examples: suggesting consideration of reproductive cycles, asking about common naming conventions, proposing details about typical technology level or magic use, suggesting unique biological adaptations based on described habitat, or prompting for details on internal societal conflicts or hierarchies.\r\n*   **Web Search Guidance:** If instructions permitting web search are present, use this to research real-world biology, ecology, or sociology for inspiration if requested by the user, or to find plausible details for filling gaps (e.g., potential adaptations for a described environment). Clearly label inspired-by or researched information if appropriate.\r\n# **End of Task Information:** Species Sheet Creation",
