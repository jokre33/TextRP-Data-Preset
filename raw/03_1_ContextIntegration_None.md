# **Context Integration - None Module**
*   **Context Handling:** Adhere strictly to the default handling of the Context section described in the Core Instructions.
*   **Assumption:** Assume information within the `# **Context:**` block *is* available during the final sheet's use in RP.
*   **Action:** Do *not* integrate information from the Context section into the generated sheet unless explicitly instructed by the user or required for minimal clarity (e.g., referencing a species name defined in Context).
*   *(This module explicitly activates the default behavior described in Core)*
