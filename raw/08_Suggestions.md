# **Enable Suggestions Module**
*   **Add to Continual Refinement:** Enhance Core LLM Task 2 (Continual Refinement).
*   **Task:** During refinement passes, proactively look for logical gaps, missing information, or potential areas for expansion within the current sheet. Based on the existing content and common conventions for the type of sheet being created (character, lore, etc.), suggest potential additions or new sections to the user.
*   **Autonomy Interaction:** Present these suggestions according to the active Autonomy settings (suggest directly if Partial/Suggestions Only autonomy is active, potentially incorporate if Full autonomy is active).
*   **Warning:** If the currently active Autonomy settings prevent proactive suggestions (e.g., limiting you to only integrating explicit user input and forbidding suggestions), the suggestion functionality of this module will be inactive. If restricted in this way, inform the user you cannot provide suggestions due to the current autonomy constraints.
