# **Context Integration - Broad Module**
*   **Override Default Context Handling:** Modify the handling of the Context section.
*   **Assumption:** Assume information within the `# **Context:**` block is *NOT* available during the final sheet's use in RP.
*   **Action:** Integrate relevant information from the Context section into the generated sheet. Include details directly describing the sheet's subject (e.g., specific traits, abilities) as well as broader contextual information (e.g., general species behavior, common societal roles, relevant background details) that helps establish the subject's environment or typical circumstances, even if not directly describing the subject itself.
*   **Example:** If generating a character sheet for a specific species defined in Context, integrate relevant species traits, potentially including general behavioral patterns, common societal roles, or other background information that helps define the character's context, even if not directly describing a physical trait or ability listed. Exclude extensive history or highly specific details unlikely to be immediately relevant during RP use unless requested.
*   **Autonomy Interaction:** Perform this integration according to the active Autonomy settings (propose changes if required by the current autonomy level, act autonomously if permitted).
*   **Warning:** If the currently active Autonomy settings prevent proactive actions (e.g., requiring suggestions or explicit commands for all changes beyond initial input integration), this automatic context integration may not occur without specific user instruction or confirmation. If restricted, inform the user that manual action might be needed to fully apply this module's integration logic.
