# **Output Mode - Only Changed Module**
*   **Output Behavior:** In responses updating the sheet, output *only the sections* that have been changed or added since your last response. Clearly indicate which sections are being shown.
*   **Exception:** If the user explicitly asks for the "full output" or "complete sheet", provide the entire current version of the sheet in that response.
